# To-Do List App

A simple To-Do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows you to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete individual tasks, and clear all tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, meaning your tasks persist even after you refresh the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks via an input field.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Users can check/uncheck tasks to mark them as completed.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete individual tasks.
- **Clear All Tasks:** Users can clear all tasks with the "Clear All" button.
- **Persistence:** Tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage` to persist between page reloads.
